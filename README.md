## Projects 
Here are some of my favorite projects:  
- **[Large Language Models as a Financial Analyst (Morningstar)](https://github.com/DhairyaKarna/uncertainity_in_LLMs)**:  
  - Created a Large Language Model called **QuantGPT** for Morningstar using **GCP Dataproc** and **TensorFlow** to generate automated fund analyses for investments and mutual funds, trained on 98,000 investment portfolio analyses.  
  - Designed a SaaS LLM Benchmarking model to quantify financial advice uncertainty across language models (**Llama 7B/13B/70B, GPT 2/Neo**) using distributed GPU clustering and validating 50,000 queries from real-world datasets.  
- **[Data Annotation Service](https://github.com/DhairyaKarna/Genomics-Cloud-SaaS-Platform)**: A scalable AWS-based workflow for processing genomic data with Stripe Integration.  
- **Patient Safety AI Model**: Developed predictive modeling to prioritize healthcare messages for providers, improving response times.  
- **Sports Analytics**: Contributed to the UChicago Sports Analytics club, analyzing data to provide actionable insights.  

## What Iâ€™m Working On  

### Real-Time Fraud Detection Platform for Financial Transactions  
Architected an AI-powered fraud detection system capable of processing over 1M transactions per second.  
- Engineered a hybrid anomaly detection pipeline using LSTM, Autoencoders, and Random Forest models to identify fraudulent patterns.  
- Leveraged **Apache Kafka** for real-time stream processing and scalable message distribution.  

### Self-Healing CI/CD Pipeline with Predictive Analytics  
Built a robust CI/CD pipeline for a high-traffic e-commerce platform, reducing deployment failures by 40%.  
- Automated infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**, with predictive analytics to anticipate pipeline bottlenecks and failures.  
- Implemented a declarative, Git-based workflow leveraging **Jenkins**, **GitOps**, and **ArgoCD**.  
- Created real-time monitoring dashboards using the **ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for deployment insights.  

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)  
Designed and developed a multi-tenant SaaS ERP solution serving over 500 enterprise clients.  
- Developed a dynamic **role-based access control (RBAC)** system supporting granular permission levels for enhanced security.  
- Optimized database queries using partitioning and indexing strategies in **PostgreSQL**, improving response times by 40%.
